# ELCCC Care Connect

ELCCC Client Portal, Counselor Workspace, and Administrative CRM stakeholder prototype built as a dependency-free, single-file `index.html` application using mock data only.

```

The build output is written to `dist/` and is ready for static hosting.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that builds `dist/` and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

To publish publicly from GitHub:

1. Push this branch to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Open the **Actions** tab.
5. Run **Deploy static prototype to GitHub Pages** manually, or push to `main`/`work`.
6. After the workflow finishes, open the URL shown in the workflow summary. It will usually be:
